                        | During this interactive presentation Tug will present the reasons why MongoDB has been created and the benefits of a document oriented database. The session will be a mix of presentation, demonstration and Q&A that will allow developer to get a better idea what is MongoDB, but also when it is a good idea to use it.

                        | Tug will discuss the key features of MongoDB, from the easy installation, deployment options, the query language and how to do real time analytics with the aggregation framework. Depending of the time and the interest we can also dive into some other nice features such as the GeoSpatial capabilities or the new Full Text Search.
